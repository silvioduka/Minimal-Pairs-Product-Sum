Minimal Pairs Product Sum from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka

Write a function that receives an array of integers and returns the minimal sum of the array (sum of products of each two adjacent numbers). 

For Example: 

Without sorting the array [40,25,10,5,1], the sum is: 

(40*25) + (25*10) + (10*5) + (5*1) = 1305 

The challenge is to find the best possible sort of the array elements, to have the minimal sum result. 

The expected output for the array [40,25,10,5,1]  is 225.
